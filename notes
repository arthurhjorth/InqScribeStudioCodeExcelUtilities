# main app here. Everything is passed around as lists and dictionaries.
# the main idea is that we have an original text in a list of dictionaries. A Text
# consists of dictionaries, and each of these dictionaries have
## speaker
## spoken
## start_time
## end_time
## tags

# there are different ways that we can imagine people would want to chunk their original
# text. One would be to chunk the individual utterances (dict['spoken']), another would
# be to chunk the entire body of text (flatten the content of dictionaries, then chunk, 
# but taking into account time stamps in the dicts)

# We need a chunker. A chunker takes a Text, and changes its 'working copy' 

# modules can add TAGS to utterances
# cleaners can CHANGE the content of utterances
